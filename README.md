# WebProject
This is my fullstack project for the Web Development scholar subject.

## Installation
The backend part is essentianly easy, you can only install the dependencies (on requirements.txt) for the backend, I specially recommend use an virtual enviroment. The second thing is Docker, we need to have the docker-compose software to create the psql container, the command is docker-compose up --build -d to build the database with their tables and the "-d" to run it second plane.
